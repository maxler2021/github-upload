            <p>On January 10th 2016, at the age of 69, David Bowie died from cancer – an illness which he kept secret from the public. Just two days earlier, on his 69th birthday, he released his 25th and final studio album titled Blackstar. His website issued an official statement: "David Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous 18-month battle with cancer. While many of you will share in this loss, we ask that you respect the family’s privacy during their time of grief." Bowie is survived by his wife Iman, their daughter Alexandria ‘Lexi’ Jones, and his son Duncan ‘Zowie’ Jones.</p>
